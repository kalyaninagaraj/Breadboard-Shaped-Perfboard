A breadboard-patterned prototyping board is a handy alternative to the more widely available universal prototyping board (also called perforated board, or perfboard), and if made out of glass fiber epoxy laminate, is more durable too. 

These solderable breadboard-like boards can be sourced from well known brands in the hobby electronics business (like SparkFun, Adafruit, and even RadioShack). Their cost, though, can be prohibitively high for the average hobbyist in many parts of the world. 

The owner of this repository recognizes the many contributions to open-source hardware by companies like [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) and [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/). Support these and other local businesses when possible. If you can't source their boards easily or affordably, one alternative is to get yours printed from a local PCB manufacturer. The Eagle CAD files in this repository are for a 400-point breadboard-sized board, but the dimensions and layout can be easily modified to suit your project's needs.
