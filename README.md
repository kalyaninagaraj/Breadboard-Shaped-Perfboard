The breadboard-shaped prototyping board makes for a great, and certainly more durable, alternative to perfboards. Its breadboard-like layout is also more user-friendly than both perfboards and the sturdier universal prototype board. 

These solderable boards come in multiple sizes, and can be sourced from well-regarded brands in the hobby electronics business (think [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), [RadioShack](https://www.radioshack.com/)). Their cost, though, can be prohibitively high for the average hobbyist, especially in my part of the world. 

Support your local businesses wherever you are. If you can't source these boards "easily", get yours printed from a local PCB manufacturer. The Eagle CAD files in this repository are for a half-breadboard sized board, but can be easily modified to suit your board's size and shape needs.
