# Breadboard-Shaped Prototype Board
These solderable breadboards make a great, and certainly more durable, alternative to perfboards, and their breadboard-like layout makes them more user-friendly than the universal prototype boards. 

They have become popular among hobbyists, and can be sourced from well-regarded brands in the hobby electronics business (think [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), [RadioShack](https://www.radioshack.com/)). Their cost, though, can be prohibitively high for a hobbyist on a budget, especially if you live where I live. 

Support your local businesses wherever you are. If you can't source these boards "easily", get yours printed from a local PCB manufacturer. The Eagle CAD files in this repository are for a half-breadboard sized board, but can be easily modified to suit your size or through-hole layout needs.
